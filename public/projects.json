He needed a modern website to showcase his work and share general information about the business. I started by creating a design in Adobe XD, carefully incorporating his wants and needs. Later, I developed the site using Nuxt and JavaScript. To highlight his projects, I added interactive slideshows to display images of his work, creating a visually engaging and user-friendly experience.",

My primary focus was developing an iOS widget that delivers instant feedback right after a training session is recorded. The widget, built entirely in Swift, went through several iterations based on user testing rounds and  improvements. This process allowed me to ensure the widget was both functional and user-friendly, making it a valuable tool for enhancing training insights.",

The project began with research, followed by creating and testing prototypes that I continuously improved. I designed a custom logo using Adobe Illustrator and developed a cohesive visual style for the platform. For development, I built a Progressive Web App (PWA) using Nuxt. To manage data, I utilized a JSON server, implementing requests to retrieve, add, and modify content. The platform allows users to explore posts, like and comment on them, and even create their own accounts. Additionally, users can manage their profiles and publish their own posts, offering a fully interactive experience.",
